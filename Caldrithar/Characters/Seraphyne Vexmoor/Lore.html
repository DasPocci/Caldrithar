        <h2><span>✴︎ Seraphyne Vexmoor</span></h2>
        <p><span>The fire came first.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>In the final days of his madness, <strong>Aeryx the Black Pyre</strong> descended upon Kelthorn Hollow—a nameless dot on the map, a peaceful village nestled in the forest’s embrace. The war mage brought no army, only fire and wrath and spells that cracked stone and mind alike. He left the village in ruins.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>Among the many atrocities, he took a healer. Not for love. Not for prophecy. Simply because he could.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>Weeks later, Aeryx was dead, consumed by his own unraveling magic during the siege of Arvast Keep. The war ended.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>But from his conquest, something remained. A child. Born in silence. Raised in shadow.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>Before the girl could speak, <strong>they</strong> came.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>The <strong>Flame of Vexmoor</strong>, a cult of Aeryx’s last disciples—devoted not to him as a man, but to what he represented: flame, power, transcendence. They had traced arcane fallout back to Kelthorn, seeking any fragment of their fallen master’s legacy.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>They found her.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>She had no name. They gave her none. Only titles: </span><em><span>“Vessel,”</span></em>  <em><span>“Ashling,”</span></em>  <em><span>“The Hollow Spark.”</span></em>
        </p>
        <p><span>They raised her in ruins deep beneath the earth, where sun and song had long since vanished. No affection. No cruelty. Just ritual. Lessons. Drills. The preparation for a ceremony she could not comprehend.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>For years, she lived in that silence, learning to channel power she didn’t understand—chaotic magic that slipped from her grasp, sparking wild, uncontrollable surges. To them, it was proof.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>She was the key.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>The day came. The moons turned red. The ritual circle burned with salt and fire. Thirteen robed silhouettes chanted as she stood at the center.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>And then—</span>
        </p>
        <p><span><strong>Nothing.</strong></span>
        </p>
        <p><span>The spell failed.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>She blacked out.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>When she woke, the cult was gone. No blood. No bodies. No signs of struggle. Only <strong>spirals of dust</strong>. And a <strong>journal</strong>.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>She was sixteen. Alone. Untethered.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>In the rotting ledger left behind, she found a name written in plain Common—<strong>“Seraphyne.”</strong> No notes. No lineage. No explanation. She took it.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>And from the ash of her stolen life, she claimed another: <strong>Vexmoor</strong>—the name of the war mage who destroyed her home, ended her mother’s life, and unknowingly cursed her into existence.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>Not out of reverence. Not to honor him.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>But to wear the name like a blade. A warning.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>Now she walks the world as <strong>Seraphyne Vexmoor</strong>.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>Not born of prophecy. Not chosen by fate. Just a girl forged from the failures of others.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>And if she ever speaks your name—</span>
        </p>
        <p><span><strong>Run.</strong></span>
        </p>
        <h3>✴︎ <strong>Mannerisms</strong></h3>
        <ul>
          <li data-list-item-id="e7b714c250c90e364ce8d85de08b35c75"><strong>Unblinking Gaze</strong> — She often holds eye contact too long,
            but never in challenge. It's as if she’s waiting for something behind your
            eyes to speak.</li>
          <li data-list-item-id="eff8a205fbfd174a18d5ca61fa48c0be7"><strong>Precise Movements</strong> — Every gesture, from flipping a page
            to uncorking a vial, is done with surgical calm. She wastes nothing — not
            even motion.</li>
          <li data-list-item-id="ee30729a8fbb3604cec238e5f4920694b"><strong>Pauses Before Speaking</strong> — She waits a breath longer than
            she should before answering questions, as if consulting something else
            inside her.</li>
          <li data-list-item-id="e876ca2b9d3faf0be55f3fbfd0eee2481"><strong>Sleeps Light, Wakes Cold</strong> — She rarely dreams. When she
            does, she wakes as if interrupted — alert, unspeaking, eyes scanning the
            ceiling.</li>
          <li data-list-item-id="eb6234eed79a1e21a7f7c84fc23199a29"><strong>Whispers to the Journal</strong> — Occasionally, she mutters something
            under her breath while holding her journal… and listens.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>✴︎ <strong>Magical Signatures</strong></h3>
        <p>Even when casting familiar spells, they bear her distinct mark:</p>
        <ul>
          <li data-list-item-id="edcaa111063b8dc5eaa366ffcf87d181a"><strong>Wild Magic Surges</strong> — When triggered, the air warps unnaturally:
            light bends, static charges the skin, and metallic tastes linger on the
            tongue.</li>
          <li data-list-item-id="e4135e38698f0b4f845bccd9e3f517378"><strong>Prestidigitation</strong> — Colors often run too dark, flames burn
            cold blue or violet, and faint whispers can accompany harmless effects.</li>
          <li
          data-list-item-id="ed3b28669c5ba3f1bcdb2cdb3b4eefa61"><strong>Chaos Bolt</strong> — The spell forms around her fingers like threads
            being plucked from the air, crackling in spirals instead of arcs.</li>
            <li
            data-list-item-id="ec2dd56823485ec650ebccd65dae9f0f2"><strong>Minor Illusion</strong> — Her illusions tend to flicker subtly
              at the edges, like memories trying to escape.</li>
              <li data-list-item-id="e992ce7e93f8024eb70bf96d178a5c691"><strong>Shield</strong> — A flash of mirror-light erupts — not glass, but
                a brief glimpse of her reflection twisted or older than she is.</li>
              <li
              data-list-item-id="e1e686f7badb231bf4eaadcfee6406e67"><strong>Fire Bolt</strong> — Burns cold-white at first, then ignites into
                color too bright to stare at. Leaves no embers — only scorched symbols
                on impact surfaces.</li>
        </ul>
