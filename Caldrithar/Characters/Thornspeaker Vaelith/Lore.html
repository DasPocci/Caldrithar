        <h3>✴︎ Scene: <em>Ash Beneath the Circle</em></h3>
        <p>The ritual site had been buried. Forgotten. Sealed by stone and time.
          <br>But <strong>Vaelith</strong> did not need directions.
          <br>The Weave itself had <em>twitched</em>.</p>
        <p>He stood alone, robes unmoving despite the stale air. The floor beneath
          him was scorched in a spiral, the <strong>chalk runes long since erased</strong> —
          but the <strong>resonance</strong> remained.</p>
        <p>His fingers hovered, splayed like a net.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>“Thirteen signatures. Thirteen voids.”</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He turned his gaze to the <strong>center of the circle</strong> — the single
          patch of <strong>untainted earth</strong>, untouched by arcane failure.
          Or success.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>“And one still lingers.”</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He opened his ledger. The page wrote itself.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>“Subject Echo: Unregistered. Latency spiral pattern: fourfold rotation. Residue level: unstable.”</em>
            <br><em>“Designation: The Silent Flame.”</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The chalk reformed beneath his boots, just briefly.
          <br>A spiral, incomplete.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>“She lives.”</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He closed the book.
          <br>Not gently.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>“And she does not yet understand what she is.”</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He vanished in silence.</p>
