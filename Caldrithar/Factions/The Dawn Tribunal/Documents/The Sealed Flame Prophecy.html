        <blockquote>
          <p>"And lo, from the ash of a failed summoning, a name burns that none gave
            — yet all will learn. Her silence shall be a song of endings. Her breath,
            the fracture’s tempo."</p>

            the Weave... it will remember her as origin."</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Should the flame be snuffed, the embers shall scream. The death of the
            girl shall light the path to a second rupture. The Weave will recoil. And
            all who speak her name in triumph shall choke."</p>

        <p><strong>Final Glyph (Untranslated):</strong> Appears to shimmer and resist
          ink — has been described as a 'burning spiral that loops into itself'
          <br><strong>Warning by Ashscribe Telmon:</strong> “Attempted replication failed.
          Scribes exposed to glyph suffered seizure and recursive speech. One repeated: <em>‘She was always already.’</em>”</p>
