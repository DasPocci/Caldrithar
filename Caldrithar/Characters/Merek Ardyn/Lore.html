        <h2>✴︎ Backstory of Merek Ardyn</h2>
        <p><strong>The Ember Judge</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>There was a time when <strong>Merek Ardyn</strong> wore white.</p>
        <p>Born to a pious lineage under the banner of <strong>Sol’reth, God of Radiant Order</strong>,
          Merek was groomed from youth to serve the light — not in battle, but in <strong>truth</strong>.
          He trained as a <strong>scribe, healer, and exorcist</strong>, walking the
          lands to cleanse minor blights and spiritual scars.</p>
        <p>Then came <strong>the Spiral Bloom</strong>.</p>
        <p>A noble child, possessed by a trace of wild magic, erupted in a moment
          of confusion — not rage. Her power <strong>fractured the Weave</strong> in
          the temple of Caldryn. Half the clerics died. The other half — Merek included
          — were changed.</p>
        <p>Merek <strong>survived the blast</strong> only because he did not reach
          the girl in time.</p>
        <p>He never forgave himself for the mercy he showed her.
          <br>And he never forgave <strong>her kind</strong> for existing.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>✴︎ The Splintering</h3>
        <p>Abandoning peace, Merek turned to a <strong>forbidden text</strong> in the
          archives — one that spoke not of healing, but of <em>purging corruption from the world’s soul</em>.
          It twisted his oath. The <strong>Dawn Tribunal</strong>, a fanatical offshoot
          of Sol’reth’s faithful, took him in.</p>
        <p>They gave him a <strong>new title</strong>: <strong>Ember Judge</strong>.
          <br>And a new purpose: <strong>Find the walking fractures. Seal them shut.</strong>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>✴︎ The Vision of Flame</h3>
        <p>Years later, during a silent vigil, Merek received a vision:
          <br>A girl, cloaked in ash, whispering to the Weave itself.
          <br>Where she stepped, magic <em>trembled</em>.
          <br>Not from anger. Not from chaos.
          <br>From <strong>incompatibility</strong>.</p>
        <p>She didn’t belong.
          <br>Not in this reality.
          <br>She was <strong>not born — she was residual</strong>.</p>
        <p>Her name in the vision was <strong>The Silent Flame</strong>.
          <br>And Merek awoke weeping.</p>
        <p>He rose, took his hammer, and vowed:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>“If the Weave cannot purge her, I will.”</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <hr>
        <p>✴︎ <em>Now he hunts. Not for vengeance. Not for justice.</em>
          <br>✴︎ <em>But because he believes her death is <strong>the cure</strong>.</em>
